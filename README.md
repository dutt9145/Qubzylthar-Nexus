# Qub'zylthar Nexus ($QZN)

## 🌌 The Decentralized Gaming Ecosystem on Qubic



The **Qub'zylthar Nexus** is a unified, multi-title gaming ecosystem built entirely on the **Qubic blockchain**. We aim to capture market share in both skill-based arcade gaming and provably fair decentralized gambling. The entire ecosystem operates natively on the **$QUBIC** token, implementing unified deflationary tokenomics and a shared passive income model for IPO shareholders.

## 1. Introduction: The Qubic Advantage

Current Web3 gaming struggles with scalability and high transaction fees. The Nexus solves this by leveraging Qubic’s foundational strengths:

| Qubic Advantage | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Feeless Transactions** | Eliminates micro-transaction friction, making games accessible for all stake levels. |
| **Ultra-High Throughput** | The platform scales instantly to handle peak concurrency (15.5M+ TPS). |
| **Quorum Consensus & AI** | Leverages Qubic’s Quorum-Based Consensus (PoSp) and AI integration (Aigarth models) for **Provably Fair RNG** and **Deterministic, Anti-Cheat Verification**. |
| **Unified Tokenomics** | Operating solely on **$QUBIC**, the Nexus supports the native token's deflationary cycle through consistent burns and utility. |

## 2. The Nexus Game Portfolio

The Nexus launches with four flagship titles, covering both proof-of-skill and provably fair gambling:

| Title | Genre | Core Mechanism | Fairness Model | Learn More (Lite Paper) |

## 3. Tokenomics and Economic Model

The Nexus is built on a sustainable, **deflationary** economic model using the native **$QUBIC** token. $QUBIC is the sole medium for Entry Fees/Buy-ins, Rewards/Payouts, and Passive Income Distribution.

### Revenue Distribution Model (Standardized across all titles)

A standardized distribution mechanism is applied to the fee taken from every tournament pot:

| Allocation | Percentage | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Player Prize Pool** | **75%** | Distributed to top-scoring/winning players. |
| **IPO Shareholders** | **20%** | Automatically paid to holders of the Nexus IPO share token as passive yield. |
| **Dev Team / Treasury** | **3%** | Funding for development, maintenance, and ongoing ecosystem growth. |
| **Deflationary Burn / Liquidity** | **2%** | Permanently removes $QUBIC from circulation, or adds to a community-chosen liquidity pool (*PaQman* only). |

This mandatory 2% burn introduces persistent deflationary pressure on the overall **$QUBIC** supply.

## 4. Core Smart Contract Architecture

The Nexus is a modular suite of smart contracts on Qubic, ensuring security and immutability:

| Contract Module | Function | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IPO Shareholder Contract** | Shared Revenue Distribution | Tracks token holder balances and automatically credits passive income (20% share). |
| **Tournament Factory** | Game Management | Deploys, configures, and manages individual tournament instances. |
| **Oracle/RNG Contract** | Verifiable Randomness | Provides verifiable randomness for card games (*poQer*, *Qbust*) attested by Qubic Quorums. |
| **Burn & Treasury Contract** | Ecosystem Management | Automatically allocates the Dev Team share (3%) and executes the permanent token burn (2%). |

## 6. Security and Fair Play

Trust is paramount. The Nexus ensures this through:
* **Provable Fairness:** All RNG is verified by decentralized Qubic quorums. Arcade session results are cryptographically hashed and validated on-chain.
* **Anti-Cheat Measures:** Deterministic game constraints (*snaQe*) and commit-reveal logic for card shuffling (*poQer*/*Qbust*).
* **Immutable Logic:** All financial logic is handled by audited Qubic smart contracts and cannot be changed post-deployment.
* **Non-Custodial:** Player funds are held in escrow only during tournament duration, guaranteeing instant and automatic distribution.
