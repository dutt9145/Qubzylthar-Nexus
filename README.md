### Deterministic Arcade Infrastructure on QUBIC

Qub’zylthar Nexus is a QUBIC-native execution-demand protocol designed to generate sustained, measurable computor workload through deterministic arcade gaming, consumable utility, and non-custodial access leasing.

This protocol introduces **no gambling mechanics**, **no speculative emissions**, and **no custodial risk**.

All execution occurs **exclusively on QUBIC**.

---

## Why This Exists (Computor Summary)

QUBIC requires:
- Predictable execution demand
- High-frequency deterministic workloads
- Long-lived, non-speculative usage

Qub’zylthar Nexus delivers this by converting arcade gameplay into:
- Execution cycles
- Randomness consumption
- Settlement logic
- Liquidity routing

No fees. No probabilistic outcomes. No external chains.

## Core Primitives

| Layer | Role |
|-----|-----|
| QUBIC | Execution & settlement |
| QZN | Consumable gameplay utility |
| NFTs | Time-bounded access rights |
| NEXUS | Revenue aggregation only |

Strict separation is enforced.

## What This Is NOT

- ❌ Not play-to-earn  
- ❌ Not gambling  
- ❌ Not a token narrative  
- ❌ Not custodial  
- ❌ Not governance-heavy  

This is **infrastructure usage**, not speculation.
