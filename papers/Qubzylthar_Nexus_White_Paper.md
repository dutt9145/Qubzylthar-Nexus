2. **snaQe** – Proof-of-Skill Arcade  
3. **poQer** – Decentralized Texas Hold’em  
4. **Qbust** – Feeless Blackjack  

All titles operate natively using **$QUBIC** with unified, deflationary tokenomics and **IPO-based passive income** for shareholders.  

> The Nexus defines a new Web3 paradigm: verifiable fairness, instant settlements, and skill-driven rewards.

## 2. Introduction: The Problem and The Solution

### 2.1 The Web3 Gaming Challenge

Most blockchain games today struggle with:

- **Scalability & Fees:**  
  Legacy L1s can’t support fast-paced games; gas often exceeds winnings.
- **Trust & Fairness:**  
  Centralized RNGs create doubt; off-chain logic breaks transparency.  
- **Extractive Tokenomics:**  
  Inflationary tokens and yield farms dilute long-term value.

---

### 2.2 The Qub’zylthar Nexus Solution

The Nexus leverages Qubic’s strengths to overcome these issues:

- **Feeless Transactions** — True micro-economy freedom  
- **Quorum Consensus + AI (Aigarth)** — Provably fair randomness and deterministic validation  
- **Unified Deflationary Tokenomics** — Every title contributes to burning $QUBIC, reinforcing scarcity and ecosystem health  

---

## 3. The Nexus Game Portfolio

A multi-genre, interconnected ecosystem — four flagship titles under one economy.

| **Title** | **Genre** | **Core Mechanism** | **Fairness Model** |
|------------|------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **paQman** | Competitive Arcade | High-score maze survival | Cryptographic session hashing |
| **snaQe** | Proof-of-Skill Arcade | Deterministic survival mechanics | On-chain deterministic logic |
| **poQer** | Table Game | Texas Hold’em strategy | Quorum-verified RNG (Commit-Reveal) |
| **Qbust** | Casino Game | Blackjack | Quorum-verified RNG |

---

### 3.1 paQman: High-Score Arcade

- **Concept:** On-chain maze-chase with CFB as the playable avatar.  
- **Verification:** Cryptographic session hashes confirm leaderboard integrity.  
- **Unique Mechanic:** Only title that burns or redirects 2% to liquidity pools (QUBIC, CFB, CODED, MATILDA, GARTH).

---

### 3.2 snaQe: Proof-of-Skill Survival

- **Concept:** Classic Snake, redefined for blockchain.  
- **Mechanics:** Zero RNG — fully deterministic survival logic.  
- **Anti-Bot:** Rate-limited inputs and deterministic playback validation.

---

### 3.3 poQer: Decentralized Texas Hold’em

- **Concept:** First fully on-chain poker for Qubic.  
- **Gameplay:** Tiered buy-ins (Paedocypris → Livyatan).  
- **Fairness:** RNG verified through Qubic Oracles using commit–reveal proofs.

---

### 3.4 Qbust: Feeless Blackjack

- **Concept:** High-speed, zero-fee Blackjack powered by Qubic smart contracts.  
- **Performance:** 40M TPS enables instant card distribution and table resolution.  
- **Fairness:** Quorum consensus ensures RNG integrity with sub-second finality.

---

## 4. Technical Architecture: Leveraging Qubic

### 4.1 The Qubic Advantage

- **High Throughput:** 15.5M+ TPS for real-time play  
- **Feeless Operations:** Accessibility for micro and macro players  
- **Quorum Consensus (UPoW):** Multi-node RNG attestation for verified fairness  
- **AI Integration:** Aigarth AI introduces adaptive gameplay and opponent scaling  

---

### 4.2 Core Smart Contract Modules

| **Module** | **Function** | **Description** |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **IPO Shareholder Contract** | Shared Revenue | Distributes 20% of all tournament revenue to IPO holders |
| **Tournament Factory** | Game Management | Deploys and configures tournaments across all titles |
| **Tournament Instance** | Escrow & Payout | Validates results, holds buy-ins, and executes payouts |
| **Oracle/RNG Contract** | Randomness Engine | Handles RNG generation and verification for table games |
| **Burn & Treasury Contract** | Ecosystem Management | Allocates Dev Team (3%), executes 2% burns or liquidity additions |

---

## 5. Tokenomics and Economic Model

### 5.1 Native Currency: $QUBIC

Used exclusively for:
- Tournament buy-ins and entry fees  
- Player rewards  
- Passive shareholder income  

No new token issuance ensures **organic demand** and **deflationary sustainability**.

---

### 5.2 Standardized Revenue Distribution

| **Allocation** | **Percentage** | **Purpose** |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Player Prize Pool | 75% | Reward top performers per epoch |
| IPO Shareholders | 20% | Passive income through revenue share |
| Dev Team / Treasury | 3% | Funding ongoing operations |
| Burn / Liquidity | 2% | Deflationary mechanism or liquidity boost |

> All titles follow the same model — predictable, transparent, and fair.

---

### 5.3 Deflationary Mechanics

Each entry fee or tournament triggers a **2% burn or liquidity allocation**, removing $QUBIC from circulation.  
As activity scales across titles, supply naturally tightens — increasing token scarcity and ecosystem value.

---

## 6. Roadmap and Deployment

| **Phase** | **Timeline** | **Nexus Milestone** | **Deliverables** |
|------------|---------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Phase 1** | Nov–Dec 2025 | Concept & Design | Complete White Paper & architecture |
| **Phase 2** | Q1 2026 | Smart Contract Build & Governance Proposal | Code IPO, Tournament, and Burn Contracts |
| **Phase 3** | Q2 2026 | Testing & Audits | Beta testing + external security audits |
| **Phase 4** | Mid-2026 | Mainnet Launch | Public release of all four titles & instant payouts |

---

## 7. Security and Fair Play

- **Provable Fairness:** RNG verified by Qubic quorums; arcade scores hashed on-chain.  
- **Anti-Cheat:** snaQe uses deterministic constraints; paQman and Qbust prevent replay and RNG bias.  
- **Immutable Logic:** All economic rules are smart-contract enforced.  
- **Non-Custodial:** Player funds held only in contract escrow during active play.

---

## 8. Conclusion

**Qub’zylthar Nexus** isn’t just a collection of games — it’s the **foundation of decentralized gaming** on Qubic.  
By merging skill-based arcades, fair gambling, and shared economics, the Nexus creates a **self-sustaining, deflationary gaming economy**.

> **Skill is the currency. QUBIC is the medium. The Nexus is the home.**
