# snaQe  
### A Skill-Based On-Chain Arcade Game Powered by QUBIC  
**Lite Paper v1.0**

---

## Executive Summary

**snaQe** is a fully on-chain, **skill-based arcade game** built on the **Qubic compute layer**, inspired by the classic Snake game.  
Unlike traditional GameFi models, **snaQe eliminates pay-to-win, randomness, and yield farming**, relying purely on player skill to determine rewards.

All actions — from entry fees to cosmetic purchases — are transacted in **QUBIC**, establishing a **deflationary and transparent economy**.  
No native token. No staking. No inflation. Just skill and precision.

> **Proof-of-skill gaming**: Players earn through performance, not speculation.

## Game Overview

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Genre** | Competitive arcade survival |
| **Core Loop** | Collect items → Grow in length → Avoid collisions |
| **Driver** | Skill-based progression, leaderboard scoring |
| **Token** | QUBIC only |
| **Modes** | Solo Ranked, Survival Pools, Time Trials |
| **Target Users** | Web3 gamers seeking fair, skill-based competition |

---

## Gameplay & Skill Model

### Core Mechanics

- Continuous snake movement on a defined grid  
- Growth triggered by consuming items  
- Game ends on collision with self or walls  
- Increasing speed and item density raise difficulty dynamically  

### Competitive Design

- Deterministic item placement and logic (no RNG)  
- No off-chain inputs or server bias  
- 100% skill-based outcomes  
- No pay-to-win or external boosts  

---

## Game Modes

| **Mode** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Solo Ranked** | 7-day competition epochs; top players earn QUBIC rewards (1st–3rd place) |
| **Survival Pools** | Entry fee–based pools; top X% of survivors share proportional prizes |
| **Time Trials** | Timed deterministic challenge — fastest completion earns rewards |

Each mode rewards consistent performance, accuracy, and survival instincts.

## QUBIC-Powered Economy

| **Use Case** | **Description** |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Entry Fees** | Paid in QUBIC to enter ranked or survival pools |
| **Rewards** | QUBIC payouts for top players |
| **Elite Ladder Access** | Optional buy-ins for advanced brackets and exclusive prizes |

---

### Fee Allocation

| **Allocation** | **Percentage** | **Notes** |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------|
| Player Prize Pool | 70% | Distributed among top performers |
| Treasury / Team | 15% / 5% | Funds operations and development |
| Auto-Burn | 10% | Permanently removes tokens to maintain deflation |

> **Deflationary by design:** 10% of all entry fees are automatically burned.  
> No minting. No inflation. Every QUBIC spent adds value to the ecosystem.

---

## Reward Flow & Lifecycle

1. Player joins a match or tournament using QUBIC.  
2. Gameplay session executes fully on-chain with deterministic scoring.  
3. Smart contract verifies and records the result.  
4. Rewards distributed from prize pool post-epoch.  
5. 10% of all entry fees burned permanently.  
6. Treasury allocation funds future updates and audits.  

**Skill = Earnings.**  
Every payout is merit-based and verifiable.

## Technical Architecture

| **Layer** | **Component** | **Description** |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Execution** | Qubic Compute Layer | On-chain validation and deterministic gameplay |
| **Game Logic** | Deterministic State Machine | No RNG or off-chain dependencies |
| **Leaderboards** | On-Chain Storage | Transparent, auditable rankings |
| **Inputs** | Turn-Based Verification | Trustless command validation |
| **Anti-Bot System** | Speed checks, deterministic constraints | Prevents automation abuse |
| **Client** | Web + Mobile Browser | Cross-platform access |

All scoring, inputs, and rewards are **validated on-chain**, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

---

## Anti-Bot & Fair Play Enforcement

- **Input rate limiting** to block macros and automation  
- **Deterministic replay validation** for every session  
- **On-chain leaderboard verification**  
- **Anti-collision smart contracts** to detect tampering  
- **No third-party servers** — all game logic is verifiable  

> Every score on the leaderboard must be **provable**, not just claimed.

## Roadmap

| **Phase** | **Deliverable** |
|------------|----------------|
| November 2025 | Lite Paper Completed |
| December 2025 | White Paper Release |
| Q1 2026 | IPO Smart Contract Deployment |
| End of Q1 2026 | Beta Game Integration |
| Start of Q2 2026 | Full Mainnet Launch |

## Risk & Compliance Notes

- snaQe does **not issue securities or investment instruments**  
- Rewards stem only from **in-game performance**  
- No staking, farming, or yield mechanisms  
- Fully deterministic smart contracts ensure fairness and auditability  
- Users remain **self-custodial** — no centralized control or custody
